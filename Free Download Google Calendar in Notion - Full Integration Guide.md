## Unlocking the Power of Notion with Google Calendar: A Detailed Guide

Let's explore some practical examples of how you can leverage this integration to boost your productivity:

*   **Project Management:** Embed your project calendar directly into your Notion project page. Link calendar events to specific tasks, deadlines, and documents.
*   **Meeting Management:** Create a dedicated Notion page for each meeting, linking the Google Calendar event, agenda, attendees, and meeting notes.
*   **Content Calendar:** Plan and schedule your content creation activities directly within your Notion content calendar. Link calendar events to blog posts, social media updates, and other content assets.
*   **Personal Productivity:** Use Notion as your personal dashboard, displaying your Google Calendar alongside your to-do list, goals, and other important information.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Create shared calendars in Google Calendar and embed them in Notion team workspaces. This allows team members to easily see each other's availability and coordinate projects.

**Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to embedding a Google Calendar in Notion:**

1.  **Get the Embed Link:** In Google Calendar, navigate to the calendar you want to embed. Click the three dots next to the calendar name and select "Settings and sharing."
2.  **Make the Calendar Public (Optional):** If you want anyone to be able to view the calendar without logging into Google, set the "Access permissions" to "Make available to public." **Be careful with this setting if the calendar contains sensitive information!**
3.  **Get the Public URL to the Calendar:** Under "Integrate calendar," copy the "Public URL to this calendar." This is NOT the embed code, but the iCal link.
4.  **Go to your Notion Page:** Open the Notion page where you want to embed the calendar.
5.  **Type `/embed`:** Type `/embed` and select the "Embed" block.
6.  **Paste the Public URL:** Paste the "Public URL to this calendar" into the "Embed link" field.
7.  **Adjust Display (Optional):** Adjust the appearance of the embed using the options available in the "Embed" block settings.
8.  **Thatâ€™s it!:** Your Google Calendar should now be displayed within your Notion page.
