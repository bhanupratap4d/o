## A Journey Through Time: Tracing the Roots of "Swag"

The history of the word "swag" is a captivating journey through centuries, revealing a linguistic evolution that reflects changing cultural values and trends. Understanding this journey is crucial for anyone interested in etymology, cultural history, or even just understanding how words gain and lose popularity.

### Early Origins: The Humble "Swag Bag"

Believe it or not, the earliest known usage of "swag" relates to a simple, tangible object: a bag. In the 14th century, "swag" referred to a bulging bag or bundle. This early meaning is related to the Old Norse word "sveggja," meaning to swing or sway, suggesting the movement of a bag hanging loosely. Think of a peddler carrying his **"swag bag"** filled with goods. This humble origin laid the foundation for the word's later, more abstract meanings.

### Shift to Decorative Items: "Swags" in Architecture

As time progressed, the meaning of "swag" began to evolve. By the 16th and 17th centuries, "swag" was used to describe decorative items, particularly draped fabric or garlands used in architecture and interior design.
