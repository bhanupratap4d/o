## Understanding the World of Hacked Scripts

The term "hacked script" encompasses a broad range of malicious code injected into websites, applications, or systems with the intent of compromising security. These scripts can be used for various nefarious purposes, including:

*   **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card details, and personal data.
*   **Website defacement:** Altering the appearance of a website to display offensive or malicious content.
*   **Malware distribution:** Infecting visitors with viruses, trojans, and other malware.
*   **Phishing attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.
*   **Cryptojacking:** Using a victim's computer resources to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or consent.
*   **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Overwhelming a server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

The prevalence of hacked scripts highlights the critical importance of understanding web security vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures. This free course download provides a foundational understanding of these threats and equips you with the knowledge to protect your digital assets.
