## What is the Hacking Rubber Ducky?

The **Hacking Rubber Ducky** is a USB-based keystroke injection tool. Think of it as a pre-programmed keyboard that can type incredibly fast. Unlike a regular keyboard, the Rubber Ducky can be loaded with malicious scripts that execute commands on a computer as soon as it's plugged in. This makes it an incredibly powerful tool for penetration testers, system administrators, and security professionals.

But it's important to remember that the Hacking Rubber Ducky is a **dual-edged sword**. While it can be used for ethical hacking, identifying vulnerabilities, and improving security, it can also be used for malicious purposes. This course is strictly focused on **ethical and legal use** of the Rubber Ducky.
