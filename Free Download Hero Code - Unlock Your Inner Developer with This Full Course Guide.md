*   Setting up your development environment: installing the necessary software and tools.
*   Writing your first program: a simple "Hello, World!" example.

**Module 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators**

*   Understanding variables: how to store and manipulate data in your programs.
*   Exploring different data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc.
*   Working with operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
*   Performing basic calculations and manipulating text.

**Module 3: Control Flow: Conditional Statements**

*   Understanding conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
*   Making decisions in your programs based on different conditions.
*   Implementing logic to handle various scenarios and user inputs.
*   Writing programs that respond intelligently to different situations.

**Module 4: Control Flow: Loops**

*   Understanding loops: `for` and `while`.
*   Repeating blocks of code multiple times.
*   Iterating over data structures (e.g., lists, arrays).
*   Automating repetitive tasks and processing large amounts of data.

**Module 5: Functions**

*   Understanding functions: how to define and call reusable blocks of code.
*   Passing arguments to functions and returning values.
*   Organizing your code into modular and maintainable units.
*   Improving code reusability and reducing redundancy.

**Module 6: Data Structures: Arrays/Lists**

*   Understanding arrays/lists: how to store and access collections of data.
*   Performing operations on arrays/lists: adding, removing, and modifying elements.
*   Iterating over arrays/lists using loops.
*   Storing and processing large datasets efficiently.

**Module 7: Debugging and Error Handling**

*   Understanding common types of errors: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.
*   Using debugging tools to identify and fix errors in your code.
*   Implementing error handling techniques to prevent your programs from crashing.
*   Writing robust and reliable code.

**Module 8: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

*   Understanding the basic concepts of OOP: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
*   Creating your own classes and objects.
*   Using inheritance to create reusable code.
*   Implementing polymorphism to create flexible and extensible systems.

**Module 9: Basic Algorithms**

*   Introduction to fundamental algorithms like searching and sorting.
*   Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms.
*   Implementing basic sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort).
